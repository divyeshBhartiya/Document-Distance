Eating raw fish didn't sound like a good idea. 
"It's a delicacy in Japan," didn't seem to make it any more appetizing. 
Raw fish is raw fish, delicacy or not.
The day had begun on a bright note. 
The sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week, and the birds were singing in its warmth.
There was no way to anticipate what was about to happen. 
It was a worst-case scenario and there was no way out of it.
He picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone.

Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. 
They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. 
She was rather handsome than beautiful. 
Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. 
Her manner was engaging.
She counted. One. 
She could hear the steps coming closer. 
Two. Puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth. Three. 
He stopped beside her. Four. She pulled the trigger of the gun.
According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution on May 12, 1939, “College Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for Educational purposes west of the Rocky Mountains. 
Here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned professions.”
What have you noticed today? 
I noticed that if you outline the eyes, nose, and mouth on your face with your finger, you make an "I" which makes perfect sense, but is something I never noticed before.
