# Document-Distance

## What is Document Distance?
The distance between two documents to be the angle between their word frequency vectors. The document distance problem is thus the problem of computing the distance between two given text documents.
Document similarities are measured based on the content overlap between documents. With the large number of text documents in our life, there is a need toautomatically process those documents for information extraction, similarity clustering, and search applications. There exist a vast number of complex algorithms to solve this problem. One of such algorithms is a cosine similarity - a vector based similarity measure. The cosine distance of two documents is defined by the angle between their feature vectors which are, in our case, word frequency vectors. The word frequency distribution of a document is a mapping from words to their frequency count.
