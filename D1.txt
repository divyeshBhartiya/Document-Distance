A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of thought. 
The word originates from the Latin documentum, which denotes a "teaching" or "lesson": the verb doceō denotes "to teach". 
In the past, the word was usually used to denote a written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. 
In the computer age, "document" usually denotes a primarily textual computer file, including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and images. 
Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its transmission medium, e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents. 
"Documentation" is distinct because it has more denotations than "document". 
Documents are also distinguished from "realia", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of "document" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2 dimensional representations. 
While documents are able to have large varieties of customization, all documents are able to be shared freely, and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. 
History, events, examples, opinion, etc. all can be expressed in documents.

Documents are also distinguished from "realia", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of "document" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2 dimensional representations. 
While documents are able to have large varieties of customization, all documents are able to be shared freely, and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also.

Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. 
When you purchase a child the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. 
When you purchase the latest gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself.
He ordered his regular breakfast. 
Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns, and two strips of bacon. 
He continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new. 
This was also part of the routine. 
A few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all. 
It was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years.
He couldn't move. His head throbbed and spun. 
He couldn't decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night. 
It was probably a combination of both.
At that moment he had a thought that he'd never imagine he'd consider. 
"I could just cheat," he thought, "and that would solve the problem." 
He tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent. 
It didn't want to go away and, if he was honest with himself, he didn't want it to.
I've rented a car in Las Vegas and have reserved a hotel in Twentynine Palms which is just north of Joshua Tree. 
We'll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave National Preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down. 
Then spend all day on Monday at Joshua Tree. 
We can decide the next morning if we want to do more in Joshua Tree or Mojave before we head back.
He looked at the sand. Picking up a handful, he wondered how many grains were in his hand. 
Hundreds of thousands? "Not enough," the said under his breath. I need more.
The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years. 
It wore those scars with pride, feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it. 
The scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty. 
The jacket was in its prime and it knew it.
I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be." 
That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. 
Maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that "meant to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. 
But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. It's the way the cookie crumbles. 
And now I want a cookie.
They rushed out the door, grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need. 
There was no time to double-check to make sure they weren't leaving something important behind. 
Everything was thrown into the car and they sped off.
